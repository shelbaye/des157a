            <p>The article "Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Ansari gives multiple tips on how to create efficient web form design and why these tips work. These design practices range from chunking information, giving feedback to the user, and utilizing basic design principles such as Gestalt's. All the various tips presented by the author consisted of one common theme: making sure the form is user-friendly. Most of these tips focus on making the form-filling experience as easy, inviting and simple as possible. Aside from the useful tips, the author continuously drills the idea of good user experience into the reader's head. </p>
            <p>One thing I learned from the article is to avoid using inline labels and placeholder texts. In my previous UI/UX classes, I used these elements and thought it was a better design practice than implementing label proximity. However, after reading the article, I will use inline elements less often. Simple login and signup forms on social media apps are probably the only time I will use this technique in the future. 
            </p>

            <p>One website that I think exemplifies these best practices is this <a href=https://pets.byspotify.com>Spotify Pets Playlist Form</a>. It asks a simple easy question on each page, has a progress bar on top, cute loading animations, and its feedback invites the user to keep on filling out the form.  </p>
