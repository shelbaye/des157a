                <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
                <p>The tips given in the article are design practices that I have encountered in mobile gaming apps that I always thought were designed well. For example, the dragging of certain gaming elements mimicking how one would grab them in real life is a pattern I enjoy a lot when I play a mobile game. There were also DONTS that I noticed were part of designs I disliked when playing certain games. For example, there are some apps where the "cancel" and "confirm" button are switched from the usual default position; I always remember getting pretty annoyed when I would automatically press the "right" button then having to restart to fix my choice. </p>
                <p>I do appreciate the tips, but I feel like a lot of these tips leaned a lot towards dark UX. I would've liked seeing more tips on how to make the gaming experience itself better rather than maximizing profits such as paying for the full version or reward videos.</p>

                    <figcaption>Shelby Corpuz - 2024</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This picture is interesting because it shows a pixelated version of a figurine I own. Somebody may see this image and just assume it is a pixelated creation of the Pokémon Piplup, but it is actually a recreation of a Piplup figurine I personally own.</p>

                <p>This image serves as a sort of title image or "thumbnail" for the fictional games I will present in my project. I chose a pixelated image to represent the figurine to convey the "video game" theme. </p>

                <p>My collection represents the toys I cherish in my life and how I would imagine playing with them in a video game. It's a little deep dive into my imagination in regards to a small part of my life.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>This image is about a cat wearing a banana hat. This is the owner's cat.</p>
                <p>The most interesting part aspects of the image is the banana hat on top of the cat and the solemn expression it has on its face.</p>
                <p>The most obvious aspect of the image is the focus on the cat and the hat it has on. The most mysterious aspect is where the cat is focusing its gaze on; it seems to be something behind the camera.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>

                <img src="../images/imageExample.png" alt="Marc Yen Portfolio">

                <p>In the article "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills", by nytimes, the author describes how to make photos more engaging and meaningful for the reader. Some of the tips include looking at the details and asking questions which I think are 
                </p>

                <p>I discovered a beautifully done portfolio website by Marc Yen which showcases who he is and his creative works. There are a lot of images that showcase his work but one particular image stood out to me was from his Pâte Bakeries work. There was an image that did not show any of his branding print and digital design (except an unfocused logo in the background) but it instead showed a worker from the bakery simply doing their job. </p>
                
               
                <p>Using the"asking questions" tip from the article, I wondered why Marc would show this picture even if it did not have anything to do with his work. However, it made me realize he was probably trying to convey the "warmness" the bakery provides; thus still branding the company 
                indirectly. </p>

            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>

            <p>In the article Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows, by Naema Baskanderi, the author explains what a modal window is and gives tips on how to create user-friendly versions of this type of application. </p>
            <p>Some tips I think were useful to me were to darken the parent screen while the modal window is up, make labels as concise as possible, and to make the element appear on the upper half of the screen.I have not created a modal element by coding and even in UI/UX design so I will utilize these tips for the time I create my very first modal window. </p>

            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>

            <img src="../images/spotifyform.png" alt="Spotify Web Form">
            
            <p>The article "Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Ansari gives multiple tips on how to create efficient web form design and why these tips work. These design practices range from chunking information, giving feedback to the user, and utilizing basic design principles such as Gestalt's. All the various tips presented by the author consisted of one common theme: making sure the form is user-friendly. Most of these tips focus on making the form-filling experience as easy, inviting and simple as possible. Aside from the useful tips, the author continuously drills the idea of good user experience into the reader's head. </p>
            <p>One thing I learned from the article is to avoid using inline labels and placeholder texts. In my previous UI/UX classes, I used these elements and thought it was a better design practice than implementing label proximity. However, after reading the article, I will use inline elements less often. Simple login and signup forms on social media apps are probably the only time I will use this technique in the future. 
            </p>

            <p>One website that I think exemplifies these best practices is this <a href=https://pets.byspotify.com>Spotify Pets Playlist Form</a>. It asks a simple easy question on each page, has a progress bar on top, cute loading animations, and its feedback invites the user to keep on filling out the form.  </p>
