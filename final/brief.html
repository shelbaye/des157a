            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>I am choosing to do the Every Picture project because it has a lot of potential to become something more interactive and elaborative.</p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>I plan to improve functionality by adding a p5 JS editor that one can access by clicking a new "play" button. The user will be able to play a mini-game for each figurine. I also plan on improving the design by making the scrolling of the game images resemble a switch more closely. Lastly, I will improve usability by adding an extra overlay when one clicks on my profile. My main focus will be on the functionality or the ability to access a mini game when clicking on the overlay. I want to focus on expanding the potential of my final project. </p>

            <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
            <p>I will probably ask a graduate TA or professor Mead to help with the project. I think one of them should be able to help me implement a p5 JS editor into an HTML.</p>
